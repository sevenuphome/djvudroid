    <string name="hello">
        To use DjvuDroid you should open your favorite file manager (for example ASTRO)
        and register new mime type: 'image/djvu' for djvu files (*.djv, *.djvu). After that
        you can open djvu files from your file manager. Note important thing about memory consumption.
        Java DjVu library used by DjvuDroid targeted at 64MB versus 16MB allocation per android application.
        Hence it may crash occasionally with Out of Memory. Especially when you open two documents in one process.
        To minimize crashes use Exit menu action that stops VM and frees all process memory immediately. Feel free to send us
        your feedback at http://code.google.com/p/djvudroid/ as issues.
