        To use DjvuDroid you should open your favorite file manager (for example ASTRO)
        and register new mime type: 'image/djvu' for djvu files (*.djv, *.djvu). After that
        you can open djvu files from your file manager. Note about essential tool that minimizes crashes caused by out of memory errors.
        To minimize crashes use Exit menu action that stops VM and frees all process memory immediately. Feel free to send us
        your feedback at http://code.google.com/p/djvudroid/ as issues.
